# ![Pinimatic](https://github.com/arctelix/pinimatic/raw/master/logo.png)


Pinimatic is a self-hosted, [Pinterest][0] inspired by [Wookmark][1] and
built on top of Django. Originally started as [Pinry][2], I greatly expanded upon the basic
Pinry it to make a fully functional, socially integrated, pinboard site.  Pinimatic is currently in 
Alpha/Development, some upgrades may be ugly/not work till v1.0.0 is release.

## Getting Started

### 1) Have virtualenv and pip installed. You may also need to have the build dependencies for PIL installed.

Note: On windows you must install the appropriate windows binary version of Pillow for your system.
They can be found at: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
*Remember to change the install directory to your virtual environment. 

Note: On Ubuntu you can get the build deps by running
`sudo apt-get build-dep python-imaging`.

### 2) Installation:

    $ git clone git://github.com/overshard/Pinimatic.git
    $ cd Pinimatic
    $ virtualenv .
    $ Scripts\activate (activate your virtual env)
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ python manage.py syncdb
    $ python manage.py migrate
    $ python manage.py runserver

### 3) Pinimatic has three different customizable configurations:

#### Development

Pinimatic is configured out of the box to run on django's built in development server on port 5000.
You may change the port in the settings.  The database is set up for PostgreSQL, but settings for sqLite
are there as well.
- The following settings must be configured in settings/env.py (you will need to create this file)
 - To use PostressSQL set: DB_PASSWORD
 - To enable sending email set: EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD, EMAIL_HOST_USER
- For SSL support in the developemnt environment set HTTPS_SUPPORT = True.  For this to work you must configure 
[stunnel][3] or similar to handle SSL for your development server.

Stunnel: Setup your stunnel.conf (all other settings must be commented out):

    ;DJANGO
    fips = no
    cert = stunnel.pem
    sslVersion = SSLv3
    [https]
    accept=5443
    connect=5000
    TIMEOUTclose=1

#### Production

Pinimatic is configured to run on Heroku with Gunicorn in the production environment.
You must configure heroku as follows:
- Create a Heroku account and add postgreSQL to your account.
- Create amazon S3 account and set up a bucket.
- Set Heroku env variable RACK_ENV = production
- Set Heroku env variable SECRET_KEY = any random string
- Set Heroku env variables for the database: DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME
- Set Heroku env variables for email: EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD,EMAIL_HOST_USER
  according to your email smtp server.
- set Heroku env variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, S3_BUCKET_NAME
  according to your amazon S3 bucket.

#### Staging
Pinimatic is configured to run on Heroku with the built in development server in the 
staging environment. You must configure heroku the same as above with the following changes:
- Set Heroku env variable RACK_ENV = staging
